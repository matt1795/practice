# practice

This repository contains my answers to C++ practice questions from "Cracking the Coding Interview".
As suggested by the book, I will be doing everything on paper first so I will document that work, testing, and
lessons learned.

I will be using the C++11 standard.

### Note on process

Since I am working on becoming fluent with TDD, I will first define the
interface for the solution to the question, and write tests to determine
success.
