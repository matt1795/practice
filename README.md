# practice
This repository contains my answers to C++ practice questions from "Cracking the Coding Interview".
As suggested by the book, I will be doing everything on paper first so I will document that work, testing, and
lessons learned.

I will be doing it in C++11 since it is the newwest version that is fully supported by GCC.
